# Durability and Determinism in Temporal Agent Workflows

This document explains how Temporal's durability and determinism guarantees work in the context of agent orchestration workflows, particularly when workers crash or are interrupted.

## Quick Answer

**When an orchestrating workflow with agent calls crashes and restarts:**
- ✅ Completed `agent.RunAsync()` calls are **durable** — they are **NOT re-executed**
- ✅ A new worker will **deterministically replay** from history and **return cached results**
- ✅ The workflow continues from where it left off (or from the last safe checkpoint)

---

## Temporal's Determinism Guarantee

Temporal workflows are designed to be **deterministic** — they must produce the same result every time they're replayed. This is achieved through:

1. **Event Sourcing**: Every workflow action (activity execution, decision, etc.) is recorded in an immutable event history
2. **Deterministic Replay**: When a workflow resumes after a crash, it replays from the beginning, but returns cached results from history instead of re-executing side effects
3. **Activity Idempotence**: Activities are executed at most once per call from the workflow's perspective (though they may be retried internally)

## Agent Call Durability: Step-by-Step

### Initial Execution

```csharp
[WorkflowRun]
public async Task<string> RunAsync(string userQuestion)
{
    var agent = GetAgent("WeatherAssistant");
    var session = await agent.CreateSessionAsync();

    // First agent call
    var response1 = await agent.RunAsync("Question 1", session);  // ← ExecuteActivityAsync(Activity1)
    Console.WriteLine($"Response 1: {response1.Text}");

    // Second agent call
    var response2 = await agent.RunAsync("Question 2", session);  // ← ExecuteActivityAsync(Activity2)
    Console.WriteLine($"Response 2: {response2.Text}");

    // Regular activity call
    var otherResult = await Workflow.ExecuteActivityAsync(
        (OtherActivities a) => a.DoSomething());                  // ← ExecuteActivityAsync(Activity3)

    return "Complete";
}
```

**Event History After Initial Execution:**

```
Event 1: WorkflowExecutionStarted
Event 2: ActivityScheduled (Activity1)
Event 3: ActivityCompleted (Activity1) ← Result: AgentResponse(...) [CACHED]
Event 4: ActivityScheduled (Activity2)
Event 5: ActivityCompleted (Activity2) ← Result: AgentResponse(...) [CACHED]
Event 6: ActivityScheduled (Activity3)
Event 7: ActivityCompleted (Activity3) ← Result: ... [CACHED]
Event 8: WorkflowExecutionCompleted
```

### Worker Crashes Mid-Execution

Suppose the worker crashes right after Activity2 completes:

```
[Worker Execution]
  Activity1 ✓ (completes)
  Activity2 ✓ (completes)
  [CRASH - other business logic fails]
  Activity3 ✗ (never started)
```

The event history at crash time:

```
Event 1: WorkflowExecutionStarted
Event 2: ActivityScheduled (Activity1)
Event 3: ActivityCompleted (Activity1) ← Result cached
Event 4: ActivityScheduled (Activity2)
Event 5: ActivityCompleted (Activity2) ← Result cached
[Missing] Event 6: ActivityScheduled (Activity3)
```

### New Worker Resumes

A new worker picks up the workflow and replays it:

```
[Replay Execution - New Worker]
  Step: Await agent.RunAsync("Question 1", session)
    → Check history for Event 3
    → Find ActivityCompleted result
    → Return cached AgentResponse (DO NOT re-execute Activity1) ✓

  Step: Await agent.RunAsync("Question 2", session)
    → Check history for Event 5
    → Find ActivityCompleted result
    → Return cached AgentResponse (DO NOT re-execute Activity2) ✓

  Step: Await OtherActivities.DoSomething()
    → Check history for Event 6
    → NOT FOUND - this is a new activity execution
    → Schedule Activity3 for execution ✓
    → Activity3 runs and completes
    → Result is recorded in history
```

**New Event History:**

```
Event 1: WorkflowExecutionStarted
Event 2: ActivityScheduled (Activity1)
Event 3: ActivityCompleted (Activity1) ← CACHED - not re-executed
Event 4: ActivityScheduled (Activity2)
Event 5: ActivityCompleted (Activity2) ← CACHED - not re-executed
Event 6: ActivityScheduled (Activity3)  ← NEW - was missing before
Event 7: ActivityCompleted (Activity3)  ← NEW - now completes
Event 8: WorkflowExecutionCompleted
```

## Under the Hood: How Agent Calls Become Activities

### The Flow

```
WeatherOrchestrationWorkflow
    ↓
    await agent.RunAsync(question, session)
    ↓
    TemporalAIAgent.RunCoreAsync()
    ↓
    Workflow.ExecuteActivityAsync(
        (AgentActivities a) => a.ExecuteAgentAsync(input),
        activityOptions)
    ↓
    [Activity Layer]
    DefaultTemporalAgentClient.RunAgentAsync()
    ↓
    StartWorkflowAsync(AgentWorkflow)  ← Separate sibling workflow
    ↓
    ExecuteUpdateAsync(RunRequest)     ← Sends message to agent workflow
    ↓
    [Returns AgentResponse to activity]
    ↓
    [Activity result recorded in orchestration workflow history]
    ↓
    [Result returned to workflow]
```

### Why This Ensures Durability

1. **Activity Results are History**: The `AgentResponse` is recorded as an activity completion event
2. **History is Immutable**: Once recorded, the event cannot be changed
3. **Replay is Deterministic**: Future replays of the workflow retrieve the cached result
4. **Agent Workflow is Separate**: The actual `AgentWorkflow` maintains its own separate history and state

---

## Important Nuances

### 1. Activity Retries vs. Workflow Replays

| Concept | Scope | Retry Behavior |
|---------|-------|---|
| **Activity Retry** | Within a single activity execution | Temporal retries internally (configurable via `ActivityOptions`) |
| **Workflow Replay** | Across multiple workflow executions | Results from history, never re-executed from scratch |

### 2. Agent Workflow Durability is Separate

The `AgentWorkflow` (the sibling workflow started by the activity) has **independent durability**:

```
Orchestrating Workflow [History A]
    ↓
    Activity calls StartWorkflowAsync(AgentWorkflow)
    ↓
    Agent Workflow [History B] ← Independent history

If either crashes:
  - Orchestrating Workflow: Replayed from History A
  - Agent Workflow: Resumed from History B
```

### 3. Continue-as-New and History Carryover

The `AgentWorkflow` uses `Workflow.CreateContinueAsNewException()` to continue as a new run when the session TTL is reached:

```csharp
// In AgentWorkflow.RunAsync()
if (ContinueAsNewSuggested && !shutdownRequested)
{
    // Carry forward the conversation history
    var history = _history.ToList();
    throw Workflow.CreateContinueAsNewException(
        (AgentWorkflow wf) => wf.RunAsync(new AgentWorkflowInput { CarriedHistory = history }));
}
```

When this happens:
- The old run completes
- A new run starts with the carried history
- The orchestrating workflow's unpinned handle automatically follows the continue-as-new chain
- No data loss occurs

## Failure Scenarios and Outcomes

### Scenario 1: Worker Crashes During Activity Execution

```
Workflow calls: agent.RunAsync() → ExecuteActivityAsync(Activity)
                                    ↓
                                 [Activity executing]
                                 [Worker crashes]
```

**Outcome:**
- Temporal detects the activity timeout (or worker disconnect)
- Activity is marked as failed in history
- Workflow is blocked waiting for activity result
- New worker picks up workflow, sees activity is still pending
- Activity is retried (according to `ActivityOptions.ScheduleToCloseTimeout`)
- Once activity succeeds, result is recorded and workflow continues

### Scenario 2: Workflow Crashes After Activity Completes

```
Workflow calls: agent.RunAsync()
                    ↓
                    Activity completes ✓
                    Result recorded in history ✓
                    [Workflow code throws exception]
                    [Worker crashes]
```

**Outcome:**
- New worker replays workflow
- Gets cached activity result from history
- Executes business logic again
- If same exception occurs, workflow will fail
- If fixed, workflow completes

### Scenario 3: Multiple Agent Calls with Partial Completion

```
Workflow:
  agent.RunAsync("Q1") → Complete ✓
  agent.RunAsync("Q2") → Complete ✓
  agent.RunAsync("Q3") → In progress...
  [Worker crashes]
```

**Outcome:**
- Q1, Q2 results are in history (cached)
- Q3 activity is retried or fails based on timeout
- New worker replays Q1, Q2 (returns cached), handles Q3 retry
- Conversation history is fully preserved in workflow state

## Best Practices

### ✅ DO

- **Trust Temporal's replay mechanism** — activities in history will not be re-executed
- **Design activities to be idempotent** — assume they might be retried internally
- **Use `ActivityOptions` wisely** — set appropriate timeouts for agent calls
- **Monitor workflow history** — use Temporal CLI/UI to inspect event history after crashes
- **Test failure scenarios** — simulate worker crashes to verify recovery

### ❌ DON'T

- **Assume activities run multiple times** — they don't (from the workflow's perspective)
- **Modify activity logic assuming determinism** — use deterministic decision points (`Workflow.Random`, `Workflow.GetVersion`)
- **Expect real-time consistency** — Temporal is eventually consistent, not strongly consistent
- **Rely on wall-clock time** — use `Workflow.UtcNow` instead of `DateTime.UtcNow`
- **Forget about long-running workflows** — set appropriate TTLs and use continue-as-new

---

## Verification: Checking Durability in Practice

### Using Temporal CLI

```bash
# View workflow history
temporal workflow show --workflow-id <workflow-id>

# Check event history
temporal workflow show --workflow-id <workflow-id> --output json | jq '.history.events'

# Look for ActivityCompleted events:
# They will show the cached result on replay
```

### In Code: Testing Durability

```csharp
// After workflow completes, crash the worker and restart
// The workflow will replay and should reach the same completion state

// Verify by:
// 1. Querying the workflow history
// 2. Checking that Activity events are the same as before
// 3. Verifying no duplicate activity executions occurred
```

## Summary Table

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| Are completed agent calls durable? | ✅ Yes - recorded in event history |
| Will completed activities re-run after worker crash? | ❌ No - cached results are returned |
| Is the Agent Workflow separately durable? | ✅ Yes - it has independent history |
| Can a workflow resume after partial completion? | ✅ Yes - from the last checkpoint |
| Will conversation history be lost on crash? | ❌ No - stored in workflow state and carried forward |
| Should activities be idempotent? | ✅ Yes - in case of internal retries |
| What if an activity fails and is retried? | Activity retry logic is independent; workflow waits for result |
