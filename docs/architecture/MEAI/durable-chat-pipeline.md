# Durable Chat Pipeline Architecture

`Temporalio.Extensions.AI` is a thin middleware layer that wraps MEAI's `IChatClient` abstraction with Temporal's durable execution engine. Each conversation maps to a long-lived Temporal workflow. LLM calls and tool invocations run as Temporal activities — independently retried, checkpointed to durable history, and never re-executed after completion.

This document covers the internal architecture of the pipeline: how the components relate, why the design choices were made, and what guarantees the system provides.

## 1. Component Map

| Component | Kind | Role |
|---|---|---|
| `DurableChatSessionClient` | External entry point | Starts or reuses the session workflow; sends chat turns as `[WorkflowUpdate]`; exposes history query and HITL methods to external callers |
| `DurableChatWorkflow` | `[Workflow]` | Long-lived durable session; accumulates `DurableSessionEntry` history (request/response entries) in workflow state; serializes concurrent turns; handles ContinueAsNew and HITL |
| `DurableChatActivities` | `[Activity]` host | Runs on a worker; calls the real `IChatClient.GetResponseAsync` and returns a `ChatResponse`; emits OTel span |
| `DurableSessionEntry` | Wire-format type | Abstract base for one turn's history record. Polymorphic with `ai_request`/`ai_response` discriminators on the `$type` property. |
| `DurableSessionRequest` | `DurableSessionEntry` | The user/tool messages that initiated a turn. Carries `CorrelationId`, `CreatedAt`, `Messages`. |
| `DurableSessionResponse` | `DurableSessionEntry` | The assistant's reply for a turn. Carries `CorrelationId`, `CreatedAt`, `Messages`, and `UsageDetails? Usage`. Exposes a `Text` convenience accessor returning the last assistant message's text. |
| `DurableChatClient` | `DelegatingChatClient` middleware | Intercepts `GetResponseAsync` and `GetStreamingResponseAsync`; dispatches as activity when `Workflow.InWorkflow == true`; passes through otherwise |
| `DurableAIFunction` | `DelegatingAIFunction` | Same dispatch guard for tool calls; serializes arguments and dispatches `DurableFunctionActivities.InvokeFunctionAsync` |
| `DurableFunctionActivities` | `[Activity]` host | Receives `DurableFunctionInput` with function name; resolves from `DurableFunctionRegistry`; invokes the real `AIFunction` |
| `DurableEmbeddingGenerator` | `DelegatingEmbeddingGenerator` | Same dispatch guard for `IEmbeddingGenerator.GenerateAsync` |
| `DurableEmbeddingActivities` | `[Activity]` host | Calls the real `IEmbeddingGenerator` on the worker side |
| `DurableFunctionRegistry` | Internal singleton dictionary | Populated at startup by `AddDurableTools`; maps function name to `AIFunction` (case-insensitive) |
| `DurableChatToolOptionsRegistry` | Internal singleton dictionary | Populated at startup by `AddDurableTools`; maps function name to `DurableChatToolOptions` (case-insensitive). Drives Pattern 3 per-tool `ActivityOptions` resolution. |
| `DurableChatStepResult` | Internal sealed activity-return type | Returned from `GetChatStepAsync` in Pattern 3 — carries `IsFinal`, `AssistantMessage`, optional `ToolCalls` and `Usage` |
| `DurableAIDataConverter` | `DataConverter` | Wraps Temporal's `DefaultPayloadConverter` with `AIJsonUtilities.DefaultOptions` to handle `AIContent` polymorphism |
| `DurableExecutionOptions` | Configuration | `TaskQueue`, `ActivityTimeout`, `HeartbeatTimeout`, `ApprovalTimeout`, `SessionTimeToLive`, `RetryPolicy`, `WorkflowIdPrefix`, `MaxToolCallsPerTurn`, `MaximumConsecutiveErrorsPerRequest`, `IncludeDetailedErrors` |

### Middleware Chain (MEAI Builder Pattern)

The middleware components compose via MEAI's `ChatClientBuilder` API:

```csharp
services
    .AddChatClient(innerClient)           // OpenAI / Azure OAI / Ollama
    .UseChatReducer(                       // optional: sliding window for the LLM (stateless reducer)
        new MessageCountingChatReducer(20))
    .UseFunctionInvocation()               // MEAI built-in: calls AIFunction from FunctionCallContent
    .UseDurableExecution()                 // DurableChatClient middleware
    .Build();
```

`UseDurableExecution` inserts `DurableChatClient` into the pipeline nearest to the caller. Because MEAI pipelines are innermost-last, `DurableChatClient` intercepts first: inside a workflow it fires the activity; outside a workflow the entire pipeline (including `UseFunctionInvocation`) runs normally.

## 2. Call Flow — A Single Chat Turn

### Crash Recovery

If the worker crashes at any point after `ExecuteActivityAsync` has started, Temporal replays the workflow from history. If the activity completed before the crash, Temporal returns the stored result from history — the LLM is not called again. If the activity had not yet completed, Temporal schedules it on a healthy worker and retries according to the `RetryPolicy`.

### Two Dispatch Paths Inside `ExecuteTurnAsync`

The diagram above shows the **single-activity path** (Pattern 1) where the entire turn — including any tool execution via `UseFunctionInvocation` middleware — runs inside one `GetResponseAsync` activity. This is the default when no tools are registered via `AddDurableTools`.

When `AddDurableTools` registers at least one tool **and** the chat client chain omits `UseFunctionInvocation`, `DurableChatSessionClient` ships a populated `DurableChatWorkflowInput.ToolActivityOptions` dictionary at session start. `ExecuteTurnAsync` detects this and switches to the **dispatch-loop path** (Pattern 3):

```
ExecuteTurnAsync
  └─► [loop until IsFinal or MaxToolCallsPerTurn exceeded]
        ├─► GetChatStepAsync activity          ← one LLM call per iteration
        │     ← FunctionCallContent items (if any)
        ├─► InvokeFunctionAsync × N activities ← parallel tool dispatch via Workflow.WhenAllAsync
        │     ← FunctionResultContent items
        └─► accumulate tool results into the message list; loop back
```

The workflow orchestrates the loop; each activity is a leaf worker. See [section 8b](#8b-pattern-3--durable-tool-dispatch).

---

## 3. The `Workflow.InWorkflow` Dispatch Guard

All middleware components share a single dispatch pattern: check `Workflow.InWorkflow`, dispatch as a Temporal activity when `true`, and pass through to the inner implementation when `false`.

```csharp
// DurableChatClient.GetResponseAsync
public override async Task<ChatResponse> GetResponseAsync(
    IEnumerable<ChatMessage> messages,
    ChatOptions? options = null,
    CancellationToken cancellationToken = default)
{
    if (!Workflow.InWorkflow)
    {
        // Outside a workflow — pass through directly.
        return await base.GetResponseAsync(messages, options, cancellationToken)
            .ConfigureAwait(false);
    }

    // Inside a workflow — dispatch as an activity.
    var input = CreateInput(messages, options);
    var output = await Workflow.ExecuteActivityAsync(
        (DurableChatActivities a) => a.GetResponseAsync(input),
        CreateActivityOptions(options)).ConfigureAwait(false);

    return output.Response;
}
```

`DurableAIFunction` and `DurableEmbeddingGenerator` follow the exact same pattern.

### Why This Matters

Temporal workflows replay from event history when a worker restarts. During replay, workflow code re-executes deterministically: every `await Workflow.ExecuteActivityAsync(...)` call that already has a corresponding `ActivityTaskCompleted` event in history returns the stored result immediately — no network call, no LLM cost. If you called `IChatClient.GetResponseAsync` directly from workflow code, you would make a live LLM call on every replay. Beyond the cost, the response would differ from the original, causing a non-deterministic history mismatch and a workflow failure.

The `Workflow.InWorkflow` guard enforces the correct call path automatically:

| Context | `Workflow.InWorkflow` | What happens |
|---|---|---|
| Inside `[Workflow]` code | `true` | Dispatched as `ExecuteActivityAsync` — durable, retryable, never re-executed after completion |
| Inside `[Activity]` code | `false` | Passes through to inner `IChatClient` — the real LLM call happens here |
| External code (API server, tests) | `false` | Passes through — the pipeline behaves as a plain `IChatClient` |

The same `IChatClient` instance wired up in DI is used in all three contexts. The middleware makes the right call automatically; callers do not need to know whether they are inside a workflow.

---

## 4. `[WorkflowUpdate]` — Why Not Signal + Query?

Temporal provides three primitives for communicating with a running workflow from external code:

- **Signal** — fire-and-forget; no return value; no acknowledgement that the workflow has processed it
- **Query** — reads current workflow state synchronously; cannot trigger side effects or wait for an activity
- **Update** — send a request AND wait for a durable, acknowledged response in one call

A chat turn is inherently a request/response operation: the caller sends messages and needs to wait for the LLM's reply before proceeding. Signal cannot return a response. Query cannot trigger an LLM call. Update is the correct primitive.

`[WorkflowUpdate]` gives additional guarantees beyond simple request/response:

**Validation before history entry.** The `[WorkflowUpdateValidator]` runs before the update is written to workflow history. Validation failures are returned to the caller without modifying history — no side effects, no wasted event records.

```csharp
[WorkflowUpdateValidator(nameof(ChatAsync))]
public void ValidateChat(DurableChatInput input)
{
    if (_shutdownRequested)
        throw new InvalidOperationException("Session has been shut down.");
    if (input?.Messages is null || input.Messages.Count == 0)
        throw new ArgumentException("At least one message is required.");
}
```

**Durability across crashes.** Once an update is accepted (past validation), it is written to history. If the worker crashes after accepting the update but before the handler completes and returns, Temporal replays the workflow on a healthy worker and re-executes the update handler from history. The caller's `ExecuteUpdateAsync` call continues blocking until the response arrives. The caller never sees a lost request.

**Structured response.** The update handler returns `DurableSessionResponse` — a typed value carrying the assistant `Messages`, per-turn `Usage` (token counts), and `CorrelationId`. The caller gets a strongly typed result directly from `ExecuteUpdateAsync`, with no polling, no separate query, and no conversion layer. Use `response.Text` for the common "give me the reply text" pattern.

---

## 5. Conversation History Lifecycle

### Accumulation Per Turn

History is stored as `List<DurableSessionEntry> _history` in the workflow's in-memory state. Each chat update handler appends a `DurableSessionRequest` for the incoming messages, executes the LLM activity with the full flattened history, then appends a `DurableSessionResponse` for the LLM's reply:

```
Turn 1:  _history = [Request(corrId=A, [User("Hello")])]
         → activity receives [User("Hello")]
         → LLM returns Assistant("Hi there!") with Usage { Input=12, Output=4 }
         _history = [
             Request (corrId=A, [User("Hello")]),
             Response(corrId=A, [Assistant("Hi there!")], Usage={12,4}),
         ]

Turn 2:  _history adds Request(corrId=B, [User("Tell me more")])
         → activity receives the flattened ChatMessage[] (3 messages)
         → LLM returns Assistant("Sure, ...") with Usage
         _history = [..Turn 1.., Request(corrId=B, ...), Response(corrId=B, ..., Usage)]
```

Each turn produces exactly two entries — one request, one response — sharing a `CorrelationId`. The activity layer sees only `ChatMessage[]` (entries are flattened via `entries.SelectMany(e => e.Messages)` before dispatch); the LLM always has complete context. There is no implicit truncation in the workflow.

The polymorphic JSON shape of an entry on the wire:

```json
[
  {
    "$type": "ai_request",
    "correlationId": "...",
    "createdAt": "...",
    "messages": [ /* ChatMessage[] */ ]
  },
  {
    "$type": "ai_response",
    "correlationId": "...",
    "createdAt": "...",
    "messages": [ /* ChatMessage[] */ ],
    "usage": { "inputTokenCount": 12, "outputTokenCount": 4, "totalTokenCount": 16 }
  }
]
```

`DurableSessionResponse.Text` is a `[JsonIgnore]` convenience property — it does not appear in the wire format; it returns the last assistant message's text from `Messages` at read time.

### ContinueAsNew — Never Losing History

Temporal's event history has a practical limit of approximately 50,000 events. A long-running conversation will eventually approach this limit. The workflow's `RunAsync` loop monitors `Workflow.ContinueAsNewSuggested`:

```csharp
bool conditionMet = await Workflow.WaitConditionAsync(
    () => _shutdownRequested || (!_isProcessing && Workflow.ContinueAsNewSuggested),
    timeout: ttl);

if (Workflow.ContinueAsNewSuggested && !_shutdownRequested)
{
    var carriedHistory = _history.ToList();   // List<DurableSessionEntry>
    throw Workflow.CreateContinueAsNewException(
        (DurableChatWorkflow wf) => wf.RunAsync(new DurableChatWorkflowInput
        {
            TimeToLive       = input.TimeToLive,
            CarriedHistory   = carriedHistory,   // ← entry-shaped history carried forward
            ActivityTimeout  = input.ActivityTimeout,
            HeartbeatTimeout = input.HeartbeatTimeout,
            ApprovalTimeout  = input.ApprovalTimeout,
        }));
}
```

`ContinueAsNew` atomically completes the current workflow run and starts a fresh one with the same `workflowId`. The `DurableChatWorkflowInput.CarriedHistory` list is passed as the new run's start input. On startup, `RunAsync` restores from it:

```csharp
if (input.CarriedHistory is { Count: > 0 })
{
    _history.AddRange(input.CarriedHistory);
}

// Turn-count is re-derived from the carried history (Decision #3).
// The default counts response entries; subclasses may override.
_turnCount = InitializeTurnCount(_history);
```

#### Turn-Count Behavior — Monotonic Across `ContinueAsNew`

The `_turnCount` field is now re-derived from carried history at the start of each workflow run rather than reset to 0. The base's default `InitializeTurnCount` counts `DurableSessionResponse` entries in the carried history:

```csharp
protected virtual int InitializeTurnCount(IReadOnlyList<DurableSessionEntry> carriedHistory) =>
    carriedHistory.Count(e => e is DurableSessionResponse);
```

The `TurnCount` search attribute (when opted in via `EnableSearchAttributes = true`) therefore grows monotonically over a workflow's lifetime instead of resetting to 0 on every `ContinueAsNew`. Operational queries against `TurnCount` reflect the cumulative turn count for the conversation, not the count for the current CAN-segment. Subclasses can override `InitializeTurnCount` if they need different semantics.

From `DurableChatSessionClient`'s perspective this is transparent. The handle is obtained without a pinned `RunId`:

```csharp
var handle = _client.GetWorkflowHandle<DurableChatWorkflow>(workflowId);
```

A handle without a `RunId` follows the continuation chain automatically. `ExecuteUpdateAsync` reaches the current live run regardless of how many `ContinueAsNew` transitions have occurred.

### ContinueAsNew Timing

The condition only fires when `!_isProcessing` — the workflow will never ContinueAsNew in the middle of a turn. A turn in progress completes fully, its results are appended to history, and only then does the workflow observe the suggestion and roll over. This guarantees that the `carriedHistory` snapshot is always consistent.

### History Query

`GetHistory()` is a `[WorkflowQuery]` that reads `_history` synchronously from in-memory workflow state — no activity dispatch, no latency beyond the Temporal RPC:

```csharp
[WorkflowQuery("GetHistory")]
public IReadOnlyList<DurableSessionEntry> GetHistory() => _history;
```

`DurableChatSessionClient.GetHistoryAsync` calls it via `QueryAsync` and returns `IReadOnlyList<DurableSessionEntry>`. Callers can pattern-match each entry as either a `DurableSessionRequest` or `DurableSessionResponse` to access per-turn metadata such as `Usage` (response only) and `CorrelationId` (both). To get a flat `ChatMessage` log for downstream display, flatten via `entries.SelectMany(e => e.Messages)`.

### History Reduction (Optional)

Apply a sliding window for the LLM with a plain stateless `IChatReducer` such as `MessageCountingChatReducer`. The reducer trims what gets sent on each turn; the full conversation log remains in `DurableChatWorkflow._history` and is read via `DurableChatSessionClient.GetHistoryAsync`.

```csharp
// Registration
services
    .AddChatClient(innerClient)
    .UseChatReducer(new MessageCountingChatReducer(20))
    .UseFunctionInvocation()
    .UseDurableExecution()
    .Build();
```

> **Design rationale — full history lives on the workflow, not on middleware.** `DurableChatWorkflow._history` is the single source of truth for full conversation state. It is workflow-local (no leakage across conversations), replay-safe (rebuilt deterministically from Temporal event history), and carried through `ContinueAsNew` transitions. Reducer middleware stays in its proper, stateless role of trimming the message list passed to the LLM on each turn — it never accumulates conversation state of its own.

#### Entry-shaped `HistoryReducer` for `ContinueAsNew`

Separate from the LLM-input reducer above, `DurableExecutionOptions.HistoryReducer` is an optional delegate that trims the workflow's own entry log when the workflow rolls over via `ContinueAsNew`. Its signature is `Func<IList<DurableSessionEntry>, IList<DurableSessionEntry>>?`. It runs in workflow context (must be deterministic and synchronous) and operates on the entry shape — so trimming preserves per-turn `Usage` and `CorrelationId` metadata across rollovers rather than dropping it.

```csharp
opts.HistoryReducer = entries => entries.TakeLast(50).ToList();
```

See [docs/how-to/MEAI/usage.md](../../how-to/MEAI/usage.md) for complete registration examples.

## 5b. `DurableChatWorkflowBase<TOutput>` — Virtual Hook Surface

The session-loop body is implemented once in `DurableChatWorkflowBase<TOutput>` and reused by both `DurableChatWorkflow` (this library) and the agents library's `AgentWorkflow`. Subclasses customize behavior by implementing required abstract hooks and optionally overriding the virtual ones.

### Abstract hooks (subclass must implement)

| Hook | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `Task<TOutput> ExecuteTurnAsync(ActivityOptions activityOptions, DurableSessionRequest requestEntry, ChatOptions? chatOptions)` | Owns activity-input construction and dispatch. Receives the pre-built request entry plus per-turn `ChatOptions`. The subclass builds whatever activity payload it needs (e.g., `DurableChatInput` for MEAI, `AgentStepInput` for MAF's per-step durable loop) and calls `Workflow.ExecuteActivityAsync`. |
| `DurableSessionResponse BuildResponseEntry(string correlationId, TOutput output, DateTimeOffset createdAt)` | Converts the typed activity output (`TOutput`) into a `DurableSessionResponse` (or a library-specific subclass such as `AgentSessionResponse`). |
| `ContinueAsNewException CreateContinueAsNewException(DurableChatWorkflowInput input)` | Builds a typed `ContinueAsNew` exception preserving any subclass-specific carry-forward fields. |

### Virtual hooks (subclass may override)

| Hook | Default | Override when |
|---|---|---|
| `int InitializeTurnCount(IReadOnlyList<DurableSessionEntry> carriedHistory)` | Counts `DurableSessionResponse` entries in the carried history | You need different turn-count semantics (e.g., per-CAN-segment reset). |
| `void UpsertCustomSearchAttributes()` | No-op | You want to upsert library-specific search attributes (e.g., MAF's `AgentName`). Called after the base upserts the standard `TurnCount` and `SessionCreatedAt` attributes (only when `EnableSearchAttributes = true`). |

### Subclass-accessible state

| Member | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `protected int CurrentTurnNumber { get; }` | Read-only accessor for `_turnCount`. Subclasses use this when constructing activity input payloads (e.g., `TurnNumber` field on `DurableChatInput`). The underlying field stays `private` to the base. |
| `protected Task<(TOutput, DurableSessionResponse)> RunTurnAsync(DurableSessionRequest requestEntry, ChatOptions? chatOptions = null, CancellationToken cancellationToken = default)` | The shared turn-helper. Subclass `[WorkflowUpdate]` handlers construct the request entry and call this; the base manages the turn mutex, history append, turn-count increment, dispatch into `ExecuteTurnAsync`, and response-entry construction. |

### Removed from the base in Layer 3 Phase 1

- The `BuildRequestEntry` virtual hook is gone. Subclasses construct request entries at the `[WorkflowUpdate]` call site via `DurableSessionRequest.FromMessages(...)` (this library) or `AgentSessionRequest.FromRunRequest(...)` (agents library) before calling `RunTurnAsync`. This keeps subclass-specific request metadata (`OrchestrationId`, `ResponseSchema`, etc. in the agents library) on the call-site path rather than threaded through extra base-class context parameters.

### `DurableSessionRequest.FromMessages` — auto-generation

The `FromMessages` factory absorbs the correlation-ID and timestamp null-fallback that previously lived at every call site:

```csharp
public static DurableSessionRequest FromMessages(
    IReadOnlyList<ChatMessage> messages,
    string? correlationId = null,
    DateTimeOffset? timestamp = null);
```

When `correlationId` is null/empty: uses `Workflow.NewGuid().ToString("N")` if `Workflow.InWorkflow == true`, otherwise `Guid.NewGuid().ToString("N")`. When `timestamp` is null: uses `Workflow.UtcNow` in workflow context, otherwise `DateTimeOffset.UtcNow`. Subclass `[WorkflowUpdate]` handlers no longer need explicit null-coalescing at every call site.

### Search-attribute opt-in

Both `DurableExecutionOptions` and `DurableChatWorkflowInput` expose an `EnableSearchAttributes` boolean (default `false`). When `true`, the base upserts the standard `TurnCount` and `SessionCreatedAt` attributes on every run, then calls `UpsertCustomSearchAttributes()` so subclasses can layer on their own. Production clusters must pre-register the attributes; the embedded test environment registers them via `TestEnvironmentHelper.StartLocalAsync()`.

---

## 6. Turn Serialization

A workflow receives incoming updates asynchronously. If two callers both call `sessionClient.ChatAsync` on the same `conversationId` at the same moment, both updates arrive at the workflow nearly simultaneously. Running them concurrently would corrupt history — the second turn would start building its activity input before the first turn's response had been appended.

`DurableChatWorkflowBase<TOutput>` uses an `_isProcessing` flag with `WaitConditionAsync` as a gate inside its shared `RunTurnAsync` helper. Subclasses construct the request entry and call into the base; the base handles the mutex:

```csharp
[WorkflowUpdate("Chat")]
public async Task<DurableSessionResponse> ChatAsync(DurableChatInput input)
{
    // Subclass constructs the entry; the factory auto-generates correlationId + timestamp when null.
    var requestEntry = DurableSessionRequest.FromMessages(input.Messages, input.CorrelationId);
    var (_, responseEntry) = await RunTurnAsync(requestEntry, input.ChatOptions);
    return responseEntry;
}

// Inside the base:
protected async Task<(TOutput, DurableSessionResponse)> RunTurnAsync(
    DurableSessionRequest requestEntry,
    ChatOptions? chatOptions = null,
    CancellationToken cancellationToken = default)
{
    await Workflow.WaitConditionAsync(() => !_isProcessing);  // wait if busy
    _isProcessing = true;
    try
    {
        // ... append requestEntry, call ExecuteTurnAsync (subclass-implemented),
        //     build responseEntry via BuildResponseEntry, append it
    }
    finally
    {
        _isProcessing = false;
    }
}
```

This is not a mutex or a lock in the traditional sense. Temporal workflow code is single-threaded — only one handler runs at a time on the workflow's custom `TaskScheduler`. What `WaitConditionAsync` does is suspend the current handler's coroutine at the `await` point and return control to the workflow event loop, which can then process other incoming events (including the second update arriving). When the first handler sets `_isProcessing = false`, the event loop re-evaluates the condition for the suspended handler and resumes it.

The net result is that turns always execute strictly one at a time, in arrival order, without any external locking. Each turn sees a complete and consistent `_history` snapshot.

## 7. `DurableAIDataConverter` — Why It's Required

MEAI's `AIContent` is an abstract base type with multiple subtypes:

- `TextContent` — plain text response
- `FunctionCallContent` — LLM-requested tool invocation (name + arguments + call ID)
- `FunctionResultContent` — tool result (call ID + result)
- `ImageContent`, `DataContent`, `UsageContent`, and others

When these types are serialized to JSON, MEAI's `AIJsonUtilities.DefaultOptions` adds a `"$type"` discriminator field:

```json
{
  "$type": "functionCall",
  "callId": "call_abc123",
  "name": "get_weather",
  "arguments": "{ \"city\": \"London\" }"
}
```

Without this discriminator, a JSON deserializer reading `AIContent[]` has no way to know which concrete type to instantiate. It falls back to the base `AIContent` type, discarding all subtype-specific fields.

Temporal's default `DefaultPayloadConverter` uses `System.Text.Json` with default options — it does not know about `AIJsonUtilities.DefaultOptions` and does not include the polymorphic type resolvers. If you use the default converter, `FunctionCallContent` and `FunctionResultContent` instances in `_history` round-trip through workflow history as bare `AIContent` objects. On the next turn, the full history (including those stripped records) is sent to the LLM as activity input — the function call/result pairs are lost, breaking multi-turn tool use.

`DurableAIDataConverter.Instance` fixes this by constructing Temporal's payload converter with `AIJsonUtilities.DefaultOptions`:

```csharp
public static DataConverter Instance { get; } = new(
    new DefaultPayloadConverter(CreateOptions()),
    new DefaultFailureConverter());

private static JsonSerializerOptions CreateOptions()
{
    var options = new JsonSerializerOptions(AIJsonUtilities.DefaultOptions);
    return options;
}
```

**This converter must be set on both the Temporal client and any workers:**

```csharp
// Client (external caller / API server)
var client = await TemporalClient.ConnectAsync(new("localhost:7233")
{
    DataConverter = DurableAIDataConverter.Instance,
});

// Worker (in hosted worker registration)
services.AddHostedTemporalWorker(opts =>
{
    opts.DataConverter = DurableAIDataConverter.Instance;
});
```

If the converter is set on the worker but not the client (or vice versa), payloads written and read will use different serializers, causing deserialization failures at runtime.

---

## 8. `DurableFunctionRegistry` — How Tools Are Resolved

Tool calls follow the same `Workflow.InWorkflow` dispatch pattern as LLM calls, but involve an extra indirection: the `AIFunction` instance itself cannot cross the workflow-to-activity boundary (it is a live .NET object, not serializable). Instead, `DurableAIFunction` sends only the function's **name** and **arguments** as a `DurableFunctionInput` payload. `DurableFunctionActivities` looks up the function by name from a registry and invokes it on the worker side.

### Phase 1: Startup Registration

`AddDurableTools` registers a configurator delegate for each tool in the DI container:

```csharp
// In AddDurableTools:
foreach (var tool in tools)
{
    services.AddSingleton<Action<DurableFunctionRegistry>>(
        registry => registry.Register(tool));
}
```

When the `DurableFunctionRegistry` singleton is first resolved from DI (which happens when `DurableFunctionActivities` is constructed at worker startup), it runs all configurator delegates:

```csharp
internal sealed class DurableFunctionRegistry : Dictionary<string, AIFunction>, IReadOnlyDictionary<string, AIFunction>
{
    public DurableFunctionRegistry(IEnumerable<Action<DurableFunctionRegistry>>? configurators = null)
        : base(StringComparer.OrdinalIgnoreCase)
    {
        foreach (var configure in configurators ?? [])
            configure(this);
    }
}
```

The dictionary is case-insensitive, so `"get_weather"` and `"Get_Weather"` resolve to the same function.

### Phase 2: Runtime Invocation

When `DurableAIFunction.InvokeCoreAsync` fires inside a workflow, it dispatches:

```csharp
var input = new DurableFunctionInput
{
    FunctionName = Name,
    Arguments    = ConvertArguments(arguments),
};

var output = await Workflow.ExecuteActivityAsync(
    (DurableFunctionActivities a) => a.InvokeFunctionAsync(input),
    activityOptions);
```

`DurableFunctionActivities.InvokeFunctionAsync` then resolves the function by name:

```csharp
if (!functionRegistry.TryGetValue(input.FunctionName, out var function))
{
    throw new InvalidOperationException(
        $"Function '{input.FunctionName}' is not registered in the durable function registry.");
}
var result = await function.InvokeAsync(arguments, ct);
```

Every tool called inside a workflow **must** be registered with `AddDurableTools` before the worker starts. Tools not in the registry cause a hard `InvalidOperationException` at activity execution time.

### Registration Example

```csharp
var weatherTool = AIFunctionFactory.Create(
    (string city) => $"It's sunny in {city}.",
    name: "get_weather");

services
    .AddHostedTemporalWorker("my-task-queue")
    .AddDurableAI()
    .AddDurableTools(weatherTool);
```

See [docs/how-to/MEAI/tool-functions.md](../../how-to/MEAI/tool-functions.md) for the full tool registration and `AsDurable()` guide.

## 8b. Pattern 3 — Durable Tool Dispatch

Pattern 3 is the third tool-execution model (alongside Pattern 1 — `UseFunctionInvocation` inline — and Pattern 2 — `.AsDurable()` inside a custom workflow). It gives the per-tool observability and retry semantics of Pattern 2 **without requiring a custom workflow**: the library's own `DurableChatWorkflow` runs the dispatch loop.

### Activation — registry-based, frozen at session start

Pattern 3 is **intent-based**. `DurableChatSessionClient.ChatAsync` checks `DurableFunctionRegistry.Count > 0` at workflow-start time. If at least one tool is registered via `AddDurableTools`, the client eagerly resolves per-tool `ActivityOptions` for **every** registered tool (filling defaults from `DurableExecutionOptions.ActivityTimeout`, `HeartbeatTimeout`, and `RetryPolicy`) and ships the complete dict into `DurableChatWorkflowInput.ToolActivityOptions`.

The workflow then detects Pattern 3 by checking `Input.ToolActivityOptions is { Count: > 0 }`. This **freezes** the activation decision and the resolved options in workflow history, making replay deterministic regardless of which worker process picks up the activation. A worker that joins after a session has begun cannot accidentally see a different tool list or different options. The client-side `BuildToolActivityOptions()` result is cached via `Lazy<T>` for the lifetime of `DurableChatSessionClient` — tool registration must be complete before the first `ChatAsync` call on the client, not merely before each session.

```
DurableChatSessionClient.ChatAsync
  │
  │  if functionRegistry.Count > 0:
  │      toolActivityOptions = BuildToolActivityOptions()   ← eager resolution from registry
  │  else:
  │      toolActivityOptions = null                          ← Pattern 1 path
  │
  ├─► StartWorkflowAsync(input { ToolActivityOptions = toolActivityOptions, ... })
  │
  ▼
DurableChatWorkflow.ExecuteTurnAsync
  │
  │  if Input.ToolActivityOptions is { Count: > 0 }:
  │      → dispatch-loop path (Pattern 3, this section)
  │  else:
  │      → single-activity path (Pattern 1, section 2)
```

### Per-tool option resolution

The eager resolution in `DurableChatSessionClient` walks the registry, looks up each tool's `DurableChatToolOptions` (default if none was set via `AddDurableTools(tool, opts => ...)`), and produces an `ActivityOptions` value:

| Field | Source |
|---|---|
| `StartToCloseTimeout` | per-tool `StartToCloseTimeout` ?? `DurableExecutionOptions.ActivityTimeout` |
| `HeartbeatTimeout` | per-tool `HeartbeatTimeout` ?? `DurableExecutionOptions.HeartbeatTimeout` |
| `RetryPolicy` | per-tool `RetryPolicy` ?? `DurableExecutionOptions.RetryPolicy` |
| `Summary` | tool name (for the Temporal Web UI) |

The result — `IReadOnlyDictionary<string, ActivityOptions>` — is carried in `DurableChatWorkflowInput.ToolActivityOptions` and serialized via `DurableAIDataConverter`. `ActivityOptions` round-trips directly through the converter (same pattern as the Agents library's `ProxyResolvedWorkerConfig.ToolActivityOptions`).

### The dispatch loop

`DurableChatWorkflow.ExecuteTurnAsync` (Pattern 3 branch) replaces the single `GetResponseAsync` call with a workflow-orchestrated loop:

```csharp
// Inside ExecuteTurnAsync, Pattern 3 branch
var accumulated = new List<ChatMessage>(flattenedHistory);
var totalUsage = new UsageDetails();
var consecutiveErrors = 0;

for (var iteration = 0; iteration < Input.MaxToolCallsPerTurn; iteration++)
{
    var step = await Workflow.ExecuteActivityAsync(
        (DurableChatActivities a) => a.GetChatStepAsync(BuildStepInput(accumulated, chatOptions)),
        activityOptions);

    accumulated.Add(step.AssistantMessage);
    if (step.Usage is not null) totalUsage = Merge(totalUsage, step.Usage);

    if (step.IsFinal) return AssembleChatResponse(accumulated, totalUsage);

    // Fan out tool calls in parallel.
    var toolTasks = step.ToolCalls!.Select(tc =>
        Workflow.ExecuteActivityAsync(
            (DurableFunctionActivities a) => a.InvokeFunctionAsync(BuildInvokeInput(tc)),
            ResolveToolActivityOptions(tc.Name))).ToList();

    try { await Workflow.WhenAllAsync(toolTasks); } catch { /* inspected per-task below */ }

    // Synthesize one FunctionResultContent per CallId in original order — including failures.
    // OpenAI/Anthropic reject tool turns with missing call IDs.
    var (toolResultMessage, hadError) = AssembleToolResultMessage(step.ToolCalls!, toolTasks);
    accumulated.Add(toolResultMessage);

    consecutiveErrors = hadError ? consecutiveErrors + 1 : 0;
    if (consecutiveErrors > Input.MaximumConsecutiveErrorsPerRequest)
        throw new ApplicationFailureException(
            $"Exceeded MaximumConsecutiveErrorsPerRequest ({Input.MaximumConsecutiveErrorsPerRequest}).",
            nonRetryable: true);
}

// Iteration cap exceeded — synthesize an error sentinel, do not throw.
return AssembleSentinelResponse(accumulated, totalUsage, Input.MaxToolCallsPerTurn);
```

Three load-bearing invariants:

1. **Workflow orchestrates, activities are leaf workers.** All loop state — accumulator, iteration counter, consecutive-error counter — lives in workflow code, replay-safe via Temporal event history. Activities (`GetChatStepAsync`, `InvokeFunctionAsync`) are pure leaf workers that take an input, do work, and return a result.
2. **Parallel fan-out preserves call-ID order.** Per-task inspection (no `ContinueWith`) synthesizes a `FunctionResultContent` for every `CallId` in the original order, even when some tool tasks faulted. Missing call IDs break the OpenAI/Anthropic tool protocol.
3. **`GetChatStepAsync` does not invoke tools.** It calls the inner `IChatClient.GetStreamingResponseAsync` and returns `DurableChatStepResult { IsFinal, AssistantMessage, ToolCalls?, Usage? }`. The workflow does the dispatch; the activity stays simple.

### Auto-population of `ChatOptions.Tools`

`GetChatStepAsync` auto-populates `chatOptions.Tools` from `DurableFunctionRegistry` when the caller did **not** supply tools explicitly:

```csharp
// Inside GetChatStepAsync activity
if (input.Options?.Tools is null or { Count: 0 })
{
    var registry = services.GetService<DurableFunctionRegistry>();
    if (registry?.Count > 0)
    {
        input.Options ??= new ChatOptions();
        input.Options.Tools = registry.Values.Cast<AITool>().ToList();   // AIFunction : AITool
    }
}
// else: caller passed Tools explicitly — respect that choice
```

This mirrors MAF agent behavior: callers can let the activity auto-discover the full tool surface, or pass a specific subset via `ChatOptions.Tools` to narrow the LLM's options for one turn.

### `DurableToolsNotWrappedException` — silent-failure safety net

Pattern 3 is exclusive to `DurableChatSessionClient`. The `DurableChatClient` middleware path cannot host a tool-dispatch loop — by contract, middleware sees one `GetResponseAsync` call at a time and dispatches one activity.

This creates a footgun: a custom workflow user could register tools via `AddDurableTools()` (expecting per-tool activities), use `DurableChatClient` middleware in their workflow, forget to wrap tools with `.AsDurable()`, and have the LLM return `FunctionCallContent` that no handler dispatches.

`DurableChatActivities.GetResponseAsync` catches this at runtime — after receiving the LLM response, before returning:

```csharp
var registry = services.GetService<DurableFunctionRegistry>();
var hasFIC = AgentChainWalker.Contains<FunctionInvokingChatClient>(chatClient);
var responseHasToolCalls = response.Messages
    .Any(m => m.Contents.OfType<FunctionCallContent>().Any());

if (registry?.Count > 0 && responseHasToolCalls && !hasFIC)
{
    throw new DurableToolsNotWrappedException(
        "LLM returned tool calls but no dispatch handler is configured. " +
        "Either (1) use DurableChatSessionClient instead of DurableChatClient middleware, " +
        "(2) wrap tools with .AsDurable() in your custom workflow code (Pattern 2), " +
        "or (3) use UseFunctionInvocation() in the chat client chain (Pattern 1).");
}
```

`DurableToolsNotWrappedException` extends `DurableConfigurationException` and lives in `Temporalio.Extensions.AI.Exceptions`. It fires only when the LLM actually returned tool calls and no dispatch path exists — not at startup, not on healthy paths.

### Pattern 3 + ContinueAsNew

When a Pattern-3 session rolls over via `ContinueAsNew`, `DurableChatWorkflow.CreateContinueAsNewException` carries **both** `ToolActivityOptions` and `MaxToolCallsPerTurn` forward into the next run's input. Without this, the next run would fall back to Pattern 1 mid-session, violating the activation-freeze guarantee.

```csharp
throw Workflow.CreateContinueAsNewException(
    (DurableChatWorkflow wf) => wf.RunAsync(new DurableChatWorkflowInput
    {
        // ... existing fields ...
        ToolActivityOptions             = Input!.ToolActivityOptions,
        MaxToolCallsPerTurn             = Input!.MaxToolCallsPerTurn,
        MaximumConsecutiveErrorsPerRequest = Input!.MaximumConsecutiveErrorsPerRequest,
        IncludeDetailedErrors           = Input!.IncludeDetailedErrors,
    }));
```

### Error handling — catch and feed back to LLM (default)

When a tool activity fails inside the dispatch loop, the workflow's default behavior is to **catch the exception**, synthesize a `FunctionResultContent` with an error message, append it to the accumulator, and continue the loop. The LLM gets a chance to recover.

- `IncludeDetailedErrors = false` (default) → generic `"Error: Tool invocation failed."` message
- `IncludeDetailedErrors = true` → `"Error: {Message} ({ErrorType})"` from the `ApplicationFailureException`
- `MaximumConsecutiveErrorsPerRequest` (default 3) caps how many consecutive failed steps are tolerated; exceeding it throws a non-retryable `ApplicationFailureException`
- Setting `MaximumConsecutiveErrorsPerRequest = 0` propagates the first tool failure immediately (MAF-style)

This is asymmetric with the Agents library, which currently propagates tool failures immediately. The Agents library is expected to adopt this catch-and-feed-back behavior as a follow-up for cross-library consistency.

**Cancellation during fan-out.** If the workflow is cancelled while tool tasks are in flight (`Workflow.CancelAsync()` or an external cancellation signal), the fan-out propagates `OperationCanceledException` directly. Workflow cancellation is not fed into the consecutive-error counter and is not misclassified as `ApplicationFailureException`. Callers that cancel a session workflow mid-turn should expect `OperationCanceledException` (or a wrapping `WorkflowFailedException` / `WorkflowUpdateFailedException`) from `ChatAsync`.

---

## 9. Streaming Strategy

`DurableChatClient.GetStreamingResponseAsync` has a behavioral split based on execution context:

**Outside a workflow** (`Workflow.InWorkflow == false`): the inner client's `GetStreamingResponseAsync` is called directly and tokens are yielded as they arrive. True streaming works normally.

**Inside a workflow** (`Workflow.InWorkflow == true`): true streaming is not possible. Temporal activities return a single result value. The activity executes to completion and returns a full `ChatResponse` payload. `DurableChatClient` then converts that buffered response to a `ChatResponseUpdate` sequence:

```csharp
// Inside a workflow — buffer strategy
var output = await Workflow.ExecuteActivityAsync(
    (DurableChatActivities a) => a.GetResponseAsync(input),
    CreateActivityOptions(options));

// Convert the buffered response to streaming updates.
foreach (var update in output.Response.ToChatResponseUpdates())
{
    yield return update;
}
```

Callers that use `GetStreamingResponseAsync` inside a workflow will see the full response arrive in a burst after the activity completes rather than as a true token stream.

This limitation is fundamental to Temporal's activity execution model, which is request/response. Future approaches for true in-workflow streaming could include sending tokens back via workflow signals from the activity, or using an external token buffer and polling from the workflow — neither is currently implemented.

---

## 10. Observability

The library emits OpenTelemetry spans via `DurableChatTelemetry.ActivitySource` (`"Temporalio.Extensions.AI"`). Temporal's SDK `TracingInterceptor` emits separate spans for the Temporal protocol layer. These compose into a single trace:

```
durable_chat.send                    ← DurableChatTelemetry (conversation.id, model)
  UpdateWorkflow:Chat                ← TracingInterceptor (SDK span)
    RunActivity:GetResponse          ← TracingInterceptor (SDK span)
      durable_chat.turn              ← DurableChatTelemetry (tokens, model)
    RunActivity:InvokeFunction       ← TracingInterceptor (if tool called)
      durable_function.invoke        ← DurableChatTelemetry (tool name, call ID)
```

Register all required sources:

```csharp
Sdk.CreateTracerProviderBuilder()
    .AddSource(
        TracingInterceptor.ClientSource.Name,
        TracingInterceptor.WorkflowsSource.Name,
        TracingInterceptor.ActivitiesSource.Name,
        DurableChatTelemetry.ActivitySourceName)   // "Temporalio.Extensions.AI"
    .AddOtlpExporter()
    .Build();
```

### Span Attributes

| Attribute | Constant | Emitted by |
|---|---|---|
| `conversation.id` | `ConversationIdAttribute` | `durable_chat.send`, `durable_chat.turn` |
| `gen_ai.request.model` | `RequestModelAttribute` | `durable_chat.send` |
| `gen_ai.response.model` | `ResponseModelAttribute` | `durable_chat.send`, `durable_chat.turn` |
| `gen_ai.usage.input_tokens` | `InputTokensAttribute` | `durable_chat.send`, `durable_chat.turn` |
| `gen_ai.usage.output_tokens` | `OutputTokensAttribute` | `durable_chat.send`, `durable_chat.turn` |
| `gen_ai.tool.name` | `ToolNameAttribute` | `durable_function.invoke` |
| `gen_ai.tool.call_id` | `ToolCallIdAttribute` | `durable_function.invoke` |

---

## 11. Configuration Reference

All configuration lives in `DurableExecutionOptions`. `AddDurableAI` binds options to the worker's task queue automatically:

```csharp
services
    .AddHostedTemporalWorker("my-task-queue")
    .AddDurableAI(opts =>
    {
        opts.ActivityTimeout    = TimeSpan.FromMinutes(5);   // default
        opts.HeartbeatTimeout   = TimeSpan.FromMinutes(2);   // default
        opts.ApprovalTimeout    = TimeSpan.FromDays(7);      // default (HITL)
        opts.SessionTimeToLive  = TimeSpan.FromDays(14);     // default
        opts.WorkflowIdPrefix   = "chat-";                   // default
        opts.RetryPolicy        = null;                      // null = Temporal default (unlimited retries)
    });
```

### Per-Request Overrides

`ChatOptions.AdditionalProperties` carries per-request overrides that `DurableChatClient` reads when building `ActivityOptions`:

```csharp
var opts = new ChatOptions()
    .WithActivityTimeout(TimeSpan.FromMinutes(10))    // overrides opts.ActivityTimeout
    .WithMaxRetryAttempts(3)                           // overrides opts.RetryPolicy
    .WithHeartbeatTimeout(TimeSpan.FromMinutes(5));    // overrides opts.HeartbeatTimeout

var response = await sessionClient.ChatAsync("conv-123", messages, opts);
```

The keys are `public const string` on `TemporalChatOptionsExtensions`:
- `"temporal.activity.timeout"` — `ActivityTimeoutKey`
- `"temporal.retry.max_attempts"` — `MaxRetryAttemptsKey`
- `"temporal.heartbeat.timeout"` — `HeartbeatTimeoutKey`

`ChatOptions` is serialized as part of `DurableChatInput` and carried to the activity. `DurableChatClient` strips the non-serializable `RawRepresentationFactory` field before serialization.

### Session Lifecycle

A session workflow starts on the first `ChatAsync` call and runs until one of:

- `SessionTimeToLive` elapses with no active turns (`WaitConditionAsync` timeout fires)
- A `[WorkflowSignal("Shutdown")]` is received — sets `_shutdownRequested = true`, which the `RunAsync` loop observes and exits cleanly

Subsequent `ChatAsync` calls with the same `conversationId` reuse the existing workflow via `WorkflowIdConflictPolicy.UseExisting`.
