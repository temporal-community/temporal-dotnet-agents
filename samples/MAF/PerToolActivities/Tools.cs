// Tools.cs — three tool services demonstrating the read-vs-write retry policy split.
//
// All three are registered as DI singletons. Each method becomes an AIFunction via
// AIFunctionFactory.Create and is registered with the agent via agent.AddTool(). The
// durable-agent loop dispatches each tool call as a separate InvokeAgentTool activity;
// per-tool retry policy is bound to the AIFunction reference at registration time.
