# TemporalCommunity.Extensions.AI

A [Temporal](https://temporal.io/) integration for [Microsoft.Extensions.AI (MEAI)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/ai/ai-extensions). This library makes any plain `IChatClient` durable using Temporal workflows — no Microsoft Agent Framework required.

## Overview

`TemporalCommunity.Extensions.AI` is a lightweight middleware layer that bridges MEAI's `IChatClient` abstraction with Temporal's durable execution engine. Every conversation maps to a long-lived Temporal workflow that persists history across process restarts, worker crashes, and deployments. LLM calls are dispatched as Temporal activities — automatically retried on transient failures and never re-executed after completion.

**How it differs from `TemporalCommunity.Extensions.Agents`:**

| | `TemporalCommunity.Extensions.AI` | `TemporalCommunity.Extensions.Agents` |
|---|---|---|
| Dependency | `Microsoft.Extensions.AI` only | `Microsoft.Agents.AI` (Agent Framework) |
| Entry point | Any `IChatClient` | `AIAgent` / `ChatClientAgent` |
| Routing | Not included | Workflow-level routing — see `samples/MAF/WorkflowRouting` |
| Complexity | Lower — direct chat pipeline | Higher — full agent session model |

Use this package when you want Temporal durability on top of a standard MEAI pipeline without adopting the full Agent Framework.

> **Using both libraries together?** `TemporalCommunity.Extensions.Agents` takes a package dependency on `TemporalCommunity.Extensions.AI`, so you only need to reference `TemporalCommunity.Extensions.Agents` in your project. The HITL types (`DurableApprovalRequest`, `DurableApprovalDecision`, in `TemporalCommunity.Extensions.AI.Approvals`) defined here are also used by Extensions.Agents, and `DurableAIDataConverter` is auto-wired by both `AddDurableAI()` and `AddTemporalAgents()` for the standard registration patterns.

## Feature Highlights

- Durable multi-turn conversations — full history persisted in workflow state across turns and restarts
- Durable tool functions — `AIFunction` invocations dispatched as individual Temporal activities
- Pre-tool interception — `IDurableToolInterceptor<TContext>` / `DurableToolDecision` / `DurableToolContext` (in `TemporalCommunity.Extensions.AI.Tools`) as the cross-library interceptor interface; `IAgentToolInterceptor` in `TemporalCommunity.Extensions.Agents.Tools` extends it with MAF-specific context
- Durable embeddings — `IEmbeddingGenerator` wrapped for deterministic workflow execution
- History reduction — chain any `IChatReducer` for a sliding LLM context window; full conversation history is preserved durably by the workflow and read via `GetHistoryAsync`
- Human-in-the-loop (HITL) — approval gates via `[WorkflowUpdate]` that block until a human responds
- Plugin composition — inject OTel tracing, encryption, or any Temporal SDK plugin via `.AddWorkerPlugin()` / `.AddClientPlugin()`
- OpenTelemetry spans — conversation ID and token counts attached as span attributes
- Extensible workflow base class — subclass `DurableChatWorkflowBase<TOutput>` to return domain-specific data from Update handlers while inheriting the full session loop

## How It Works

```
External Caller
    │
    │  ExecuteUpdateAsync (Chat update)
    ▼
DurableChatWorkflow (long-lived workflow)
    │  persists conversation history in workflow state
    │  serializes concurrent turns
    │
    │  ExecuteActivityAsync
    ▼
DurableChatActivities.GetResponseAsync
    │
    └─► IChatClient (e.g., OpenAI, Azure OpenAI, Ollama)
```

The **worker process** hosts `DurableChatWorkflow` and `DurableChatActivities` and executes LLM calls. Any process that holds an `ITemporalClient` — including the worker itself or a completely separate service — can act as the external caller via `DurableChatSessionClient`.

`DurableChatSessionClient` is the external entry point. It starts the workflow if it is not already running (using `UseExisting` conflict policy) and then sends each chat turn as a Temporal Update. The workflow accumulates history and dispatches each LLM call as an activity. When workflow history grows large, continue-as-new transparently transfers history to a new run.

`DurableChatClient` is the middleware that makes this work inside any MEAI pipeline — it detects whether it is running inside a workflow and either dispatches the call as an activity or passes through to the inner client directly.

## Prerequisites

- [.NET 10 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) or later to run the samples below
- A running [Temporal server](https://docs.temporal.io/cli#start-dev) (`temporal server start-dev`)
- An LLM provider (e.g., Azure OpenAI, OpenAI, Ollama)

Install the NuGet package:

```bash
dotnet add package TemporalCommunity.Extensions.AI
```

## Target framework support

The package ships `net10.0` and `netstandard2.1` assets. The latter supports .NET Core 3.1+
and modern .NET; .NET Framework is not supported. On the `netstandard2.1` asset, raw
`HttpRequestException` failures have no status-code metadata for deterministic retry
classification, and `System.Half` is unavailable, so half-precision embedding converter support
is not present. OpenAI/Azure exceptions continue to use their reflected status path.

The repository samples and test projects remain `net10.0`.

## Getting Started

> **Deployment note:** Steps 1–3 show a single-process setup (worker and caller in the same host) — the pattern used by all included samples. In production you can split them: the **worker process** needs Steps 1 and 2; a separate **client process** needs only Step 1 (the `ITemporalClient` connection with `DurableAIDataConverter`) and Step 3 (`DurableChatSessionClient.ChatAsync`). `DurableChatSessionClient` requires only an `ITemporalClient` — it does not require a hosted worker.

### Step 1: Connect the Temporal Client

Use `DurableAIDataConverter.Instance` so that MEAI's polymorphic `AIContent` types round-trip correctly through Temporal's payload converter.

This step applies to **both** the worker process and any external caller process.

```csharp
// Both: required in the worker process and in any external caller process
var temporalClient = await TemporalClient.ConnectAsync(new("localhost:7233")
{
    DataConverter = DurableAIDataConverter.Instance,
    Namespace = "default"
});

builder.Services.AddSingleton<ITemporalClient>(temporalClient);
```

### Step 2: Register IChatClient and AddDurableAI

Use `AddChatClient` — the idiomatic MEAI extension that returns a `ChatClientBuilder` for chaining middleware, then registers the built pipeline as `IChatClient` in DI:

This step runs in the **worker process** only. External callers do not register `IChatClient`, `AddHostedTemporalWorker`, or `AddDurableAI`.

```csharp
// Worker
IChatClient innerClient = (IChatClient)new OpenAIClient(apiKey).GetChatClient("gpt-4o-mini");

// AddChatClient registers IChatClient and opens a pipeline builder.
// Chain middleware, then call Build() to seal and register the singleton.
builder.Services
    .AddChatClient(innerClient)
    .UseFunctionInvocation()  // handles tool call loops
    .Build();

// Register the durable AI workflow, activities, and session client on a Temporal worker.
// DurableChatActivities constructor-injects the IChatClient registered above.
builder.Services
    .AddHostedTemporalWorker("my-task-queue")
    .AddDurableAI(opts =>
    {
        opts.ActivityTimeout = TimeSpan.FromMinutes(5);
        opts.SessionTimeToLive = TimeSpan.FromHours(24);
    });
```

`AddDurableAI` registers `DurableChatWorkflow`, `DurableChatActivities`, and `DurableChatSessionClient` automatically. The `DurableChatSessionClient` is available from DI as a singleton.

You can also chain `UseDurableExecution()` directly onto `AddChatClient` if you want the client to dispatch as Temporal activities when used *outside* `DurableChatSessionClient` (e.g., from custom workflow code):

```csharp
// Worker (optional): use when calling IChatClient directly from custom workflow code
builder.Services
    .AddChatClient(innerClient)
    .UseFunctionInvocation()
    .UseDurableExecution(opts => opts.ActivityTimeout = TimeSpan.FromMinutes(5))
    .Build();
```

### Multiple Clients with AddKeyedChatClient

When a single host needs more than one `IChatClient` (e.g., different models for chat vs. routing), use `AddKeyedChatClient`:

This pattern applies to the **worker process** only.

```csharp
// Worker
IChatClient fastClient = (IChatClient)openAiClient.GetChatClient("gpt-4o-mini");
IChatClient powerfulClient = (IChatClient)openAiClient.GetChatClient("gpt-4o");

builder.Services
    .AddKeyedChatClient("chat", fastClient)
    .UseFunctionInvocation()
    .Build();

builder.Services
    .AddKeyedChatClient("routing", powerfulClient)
    .Build();
```

Inject by key with `[FromKeyedServices]`:

```csharp
// Worker
public class MyService([FromKeyedServices("chat")] IChatClient chatClient) { }
```

**Worker-level default key:** Set `DefaultChatClientKey` on `DurableExecutionOptions` so `DurableChatActivities` resolves a specific keyed client — no unkeyed alias required:

```csharp
// Worker
builder.Services
    .AddHostedTemporalWorker("my-task-queue")
    .AddDurableAI(opts =>
    {
        opts.DefaultChatClientKey = "chat";   // resolves AddKeyedChatClient("chat", ...)
    });
```

`DurableChatActivities` uses the following resolution order, from highest to lowest priority:

1. `ChatOptions.WithChatClientKey("key")` — per-call override set by the caller
2. `DurableExecutionOptions.DefaultChatClientKey` — worker-level default
3. Unkeyed `IChatClient` — existing fallback when no key is specified

**Per-call override:** Use `WithChatClientKey` on `ChatOptions` to switch models for a single turn without changing the worker configuration:

```csharp
// Client
var options = new ChatOptions().WithChatClientKey("routing");
var response = await sessionClient.ChatAsync("conversation-123", messages, options);
```

`WithChatClientKey` throws `ArgumentException` on a null or empty key. Overriding back to the unkeyed client via `WithChatClientKey` is not supported in v1 — omit the call to use the worker-level default instead.

### Step 3: Send a Message

This step runs in the **client process** (or in the same process as the worker if co-located). A separate client process needs only `ITemporalClient` and `DurableChatSessionClient` — no hosted worker registration.

In a split deployment, register `DurableChatSessionClient` manually in the client process — `AddDurableAI` is not called there:

```csharp
// Client: in a split deployment, register DurableChatSessionClient manually —
// AddDurableAI() is not called in the client process.
builder.Services.AddSingleton(sp =>
    new DurableChatSessionClient(
        sp.GetRequiredService<ITemporalClient>(),
        new DurableExecutionOptions { TaskQueue = "my-task-queue" },
        sp.GetService<ILogger<DurableChatSessionClient>>()));
```

```csharp
// Client
var sessionClient = services.GetRequiredService<DurableChatSessionClient>();

var response = await sessionClient.ChatAsync(
    "conversation-123",
    [new ChatMessage(ChatRole.User, "What is the capital of France?")]);

Console.WriteLine(response.Messages[0].Text);
```

Each call to `ChatAsync` appends the user messages to the persistent conversation history and returns the assistant's reply. Subsequent calls with the same `conversationId` continue the same session.

## Per-Request Overrides

Override the activity timeout and retry policy on a per-call basis using `ChatOptions` extension methods:

These overrides are passed by the **caller** on each request.

```csharp
// Client
var options = new ChatOptions()
    .WithActivityTimeout(TimeSpan.FromMinutes(10))
    .WithMaxRetryAttempts(5);

var response = await sessionClient.ChatAsync("conversation-123", messages, options);
```

You can also override the heartbeat timeout:

```csharp
// Client
var options = new ChatOptions()
    .WithHeartbeatTimeout(TimeSpan.FromMinutes(3));
```

These override the global values set in `DurableExecutionOptions` for that request only.

## Durable Tool Functions

Wrap any `AIFunction` so that its invocation is dispatched as a Temporal activity when called inside a workflow. This gives each tool call independent retry and timeout control.

**Option A — Register globally with `AddDurableTools`:**

```csharp
// Worker: register tools globally — the worker dispatches each invocation as an activity
var getWeather = AIFunctionFactory.Create(
    (string city) => $"Sunny, 22°C in {city}",
    name: "GetWeather");

builder.Services
    .AddHostedTemporalWorker("my-task-queue")
    .AddDurableAI()
    .AddDurableTools(getWeather);           // params — pass one or more tools
```

**Option B — Wrap inline with `AsDurable()`:**

```csharp
// Client: wrap tools inline per-request; AsDurable() is a no-op outside a workflow
var tools = new[]
{
    getWeather.AsDurable(),
    getStock.AsDurable(new DurableExecutionOptions { ActivityTimeout = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(30) }),
};

var options = new ChatOptions { Tools = [.. tools] };
var response = await sessionClient.ChatAsync("conversation-123", messages, options);
```

`AsDurable()` is context-aware: outside a workflow it passes through to the underlying function unchanged.

## Durable Embeddings

Wrap an `IEmbeddingGenerator` for workflow-safe execution using `UseDurableExecution`:

This registration belongs in the **worker process**.

```csharp
// Worker
builder.Services.AddSingleton<IEmbeddingGenerator<string, Embedding<float>>>(sp =>
    new OpenAIEmbeddingGenerator(openAiClient, "text-embedding-3-small")
        .AsBuilder()
        .UseDurableExecution(opts =>
        {
            opts.ActivityTimeout = TimeSpan.FromMinutes(2);
        })
        .Build());
```

When `GenerateAsync` is called inside a Temporal workflow, the call is dispatched as an activity. Outside a workflow it passes through to the inner generator directly.

## History Reduction

Apply a sliding context window with a plain stateless `IChatReducer` — for example MEAI's `MessageCountingChatReducer` — chained onto the inner chat client. The reducer runs inside the activity, so it doesn't need to be replay-safe. The full unreduced history is already preserved by `DurableChatWorkflow` and is accessible via `DurableChatSessionClient.GetHistoryAsync`.

This pipeline registration belongs in the **worker process**.

```csharp
// Worker
builder.Services
    .AddChatClient(openAiClient.GetChatClient("gpt-4o-mini"))
    .UseChatReducer(new MessageCountingChatReducer(20))   // 20-message window to the LLM
    .UseFunctionInvocation()
    .UseDurableExecution()
    .Build();
```

Retrieve the complete conversation history from workflow state at any time:

```csharp
// Client
var history = await sessionClient.GetHistoryAsync("conversation-123");
```

For a full walk-through of the reduction pattern, see [Reducing the LLM Context Window](../../docs/how-to/MEAI/usage.md#reducing-the-llm-context-window).

## Human-in-the-Loop

The workflow supports blocking approval gates. From inside a tool, send an approval request — the workflow pauses until a human responds or the approval timeout elapses.

**Request approval from a tool:**

From inside a tool (running as a Temporal activity on the worker), construct a `DurableApprovalRequest` and send it to the workflow — execution blocks until a human responds or the approval timeout elapses:

```csharp
// Worker (activity context): this code runs inside a Temporal activity on the worker

// Inside an AIFunction registered as a tool
var request = new DurableApprovalRequest
{
    RequestId = Guid.NewGuid().ToString(),
    FunctionName = "DeleteRecords",
    Description = "Permanently delete 42 customer records. This cannot be undone.",
};

// Send the approval request to the workflow and block until a human responds.
// The workflow's RequestApprovalAsync update handler pauses execution until
// SubmitApprovalAsync is called externally with a matching RequestId.
var handle = temporalClient.GetWorkflowHandle(conversationId);
var decision = await handle.ExecuteUpdateAsync<DurableApprovalDecision>(
    "RequestApproval",
    new object[] { request });

if (!decision.Approved)
    throw new InvalidOperationException($"Action rejected: {decision.Reason}");
```

**From an external system (e.g., an admin dashboard):**

The polling and submission calls are made by an **external client** (or any process with access to an `ITemporalClient`).

```csharp
// Client
// Poll for a pending request
var pending = await sessionClient.GetPendingApprovalAsync("conversation-123");
if (pending is not null)
{
    await sessionClient.SubmitApprovalAsync(
        "conversation-123",
        new DurableApprovalDecision
        {
            RequestId = pending.RequestId,
            Approved = true,
            Reason = "Reviewed and approved by admin."
        });
}
```

The workflow's `RequestApprovalAsync` update blocks on `WaitConditionAsync` until `SubmitApprovalAsync` is called with a matching `RequestId`. If the `ApprovalTimeout` elapses with no response, the decision returns `Approved = false` automatically.

Configure the approval timeout in `DurableExecutionOptions`:

```csharp
// Worker: configure via AddDurableAI on the worker builder
.AddDurableAI(opts =>
{
    opts.ApprovalTimeout = TimeSpan.FromDays(3);
});
```

## Plugin Support

> **Experimental:** These APIs carry the `TAI001` diagnostic. Suppress with `#pragma warning disable TAI001`.

Use `.AddWorkerPlugin()` and `.AddClientPlugin()` to compose any Temporal SDK plugin (OTel tracing, encryption codecs, custom interceptors) with the hosted worker:

Worker plugins apply to the **worker process**; client plugins apply to the Temporal client, which may live in the worker or in a separate caller process.

**Worker plugin on a hosted worker:**

```csharp
// Worker
builder.Services
    .AddHostedTemporalWorker("localhost:7233", "default", "my-queue")
    .AddDurableAI()
    .AddWorkerPlugin(new TracingPlugin());   // ITemporalWorkerPlugin
```

**Client plugin on a hosted worker** (only applies when the worker creates its own client via the 3-arg overload):

```csharp
// Worker
builder.Services
    .AddHostedTemporalWorker("localhost:7233", "default", "my-queue")
    .AddDurableAI()
    .AddClientPlugin(new EncryptionPlugin());   // ITemporalClientPlugin
```

**Client plugin on a standalone client** (no hosted worker):

```csharp
// Client: use this when the caller runs in a separate process with no hosted worker
builder.Services
    .AddTemporalClient("localhost:7233", "default")
    .AddClientPlugin(new EncryptionPlugin());
```

### DurableAIPlugin — alternative registration path

`DurableAIPlugin` is an `ITemporalWorkerPlugin` that registers the durable AI workflow, activities, function registry, session client, and `DurableAIDataConverter` auto-wiring — the same DI state produced by `AddDurableAI()`. It exists alongside `AddDurableAI()` so users composing with other Temporal partner plugins can keep a uniform `.AddWorkerPlugin(...)` registration style. This matches the canonical "AI Agent SDK" pattern from the Temporal AI Partner Ecosystem Guide, which describes plugins as the standard partner integration mechanism. Both call sites are equivalent — pick whichever fits your composition style. `AddDurableAI()` remains the lowest-friction option and is the primary example shown in the user-facing docs.

| Plugin | Type | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `DurableAIPlugin` | `ITemporalWorkerPlugin` | Alternative entry point that registers durable AI workflow, activities, registry, session client, and data converter auto-wiring |
| `DurableAIDataConverterPlugin` | `ITemporalClientPlugin` | Applies `DurableAIDataConverter` to the Temporal client. Auto-registered by `AddDurableAI()` and `DurableAIPlugin` for the two managed registration patterns; available standalone for manual composition. |

```csharp
// Existing entry point — unchanged, primary example
#pragma warning disable TAI001
builder.Services
    .AddHostedTemporalWorker("localhost:7233", "default", "my-queue")
    .AddDurableAI(o => o.ActivityTimeout = TimeSpan.FromMinutes(5));
#pragma warning restore TAI001

// Alternative entry point — same DI state, plugin-style composition
#pragma warning disable TAI001
builder.Services
    .AddHostedTemporalWorker("localhost:7233", "default", "my-queue")
    .AddWorkerPlugin(new DurableAIPlugin(o => o.ActivityTimeout = TimeSpan.FromMinutes(5)));
#pragma warning restore TAI001
```

`DurableAIPlugin` constructors: `()`, `(Action<DurableExecutionOptions> configure)`, and `(DurableExecutionOptions options)`. The `AddWorkerPlugin(DurableAIPlugin)` overload is the only supported way to register the plugin — it queues the plugin and registers DI services in one call, because activities cannot be registered from `ConfigureWorker` directly (no `IServiceProvider` at that hook). Both entry points are gated by `[Experimental("TAI001")]`.

Mixing the two paths on the same builder is safe: DI services use `TryAdd*` semantics, and `DurableAIDataConverterPlugin` is deduplicated by plugin `Name` before being pushed into `ClientOptions.Plugins`, so no double-stacking occurs.

### DurableAIDataConverter auto-wiring

Both `AddDurableAI()` and `AddWorkerPlugin(new DurableAIPlugin())` automatically apply `DurableAIDataConverter` to the Temporal client for the two most common registration patterns:

| Pattern | How it's applied |
|---|---|
| `AddTemporalClient(addr, ns)` | Via `IConfigureOptions<TemporalClientConnectOptions>` |
| `AddHostedTemporalWorker(addr, ns, queue)` | Via `IPostConfigureOptions<TemporalWorkerServiceOptions>` |
| Manual `TemporalClient.ConnectAsync` + `AddSingleton` | **Not** auto-wired — set `DataConverter = DurableAIDataConverter.Instance` explicitly |

### Activity summaries in the Temporal UI

Activity dispatch sites populate `ActivityOptions.Summary` automatically — there is no public API knob to set it. The Chat activity uses `ChatOptions.ModelId`, the durable tool activity uses the function `Name`, and the embedding activity uses `EmbeddingGenerationOptions.ModelId`. When the underlying field is null or empty the summary is omitted. See the Temporal "enriching the UI" doc for how this renders: https://docs.temporal.io/develop/dotnet/platform/enriching-ui#adding-summary-to-activities-and-timers.

## Data Converter

`DurableAIDataConverter.Instance` is a `DataConverter` whose JSON serializer uses `AIJsonUtilities.DefaultOptions`. MEAI types such as `ChatMessage` and `AIContent` subtypes use a `$type` discriminator for polymorphic serialization. Without this converter, type information for content subtypes like `FunctionCallContent` and `FunctionResultContent` may be lost when round-tripping through Temporal's workflow history.

Register it on the `TemporalClient` (and ensure the same converter is used by any hosted workers):

```csharp
// Both: required on any process that communicates with Temporal
var client = await TemporalClient.ConnectAsync(new("localhost:7233")
{
    DataConverter = DurableAIDataConverter.Instance
});
```

Or on a hosted worker directly:

```csharp
// Worker: alternatively, apply on the hosted worker options directly
services.AddHostedTemporalWorker(opts =>
{
    opts.DataConverter = DurableAIDataConverter.Instance;
});
```

## Core Components
